# Minesweeper-JavaScript

This is my very old project in JavaScript.
This code has several errors :

1. Click on the boxes to the upper left corner.
2. When an alert about the end of the game is displayed,
   the game does not end, you must refresh the page to start new game.
   
When I have time I am going to fix these errors.
